# Python-LangChain

A comprehensive repository for learning and implementing LangChain projects in Python.

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables developers to build sophisticated applications that can:

- **Chain multiple LLM calls together** - Combine multiple language model operations in a sequence
- **Interact with external data sources** - Integrate with databases, APIs, and knowledge bases
- **Create intelligent agents** - Build autonomous systems that can reason and take actions
- **Memory management** - Maintain context across conversations and interactions
- **Vector databases integration** - Work with embeddings for semantic search and retrieval

## Key Features

- **LLM Integration**: Easy integration with various language models (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
- **Chains**: Combine multiple components into a single, coherent workflow
- **Agents**: Create intelligent agents that can use tools and make decisions
- **Memory**: Built-in memory systems for maintaining conversation history
- **Document Processing**: Load, split, and process documents efficiently
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combine language models with external knowledge sources
- **Prompt Management**: Templates and optimization for prompts

## Installation

```bash
pip install langchain
```

## Getting Started

To get started with LangChain, you'll need:

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **An API key** for your chosen LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI)
3. **LangChain library** installed via pip
